Reflections and Comments

Lab-02 Thoughts: So far I am feeling confident after building this portion out. Looking forward to cleaning this thing up. DRY code is a BEAUTIFUL thing. 

Lab-03 thoughts: Had a bit of trouble with Q6. While loop. I was overthinking the process of how the computer runs through the process of the loop. I will continue to practice these until they become second nature. Overall a good challenge and I had a lot of fun. The banging of the head against the desk will live to fight another day.
